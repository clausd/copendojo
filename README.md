Copenhagen Coderdojo code sharing central!


*Welcome to the Copenhagen Coderdojo sandbox*

This repo is public - and we invite all mentors/helpers/hangarounds of the Copenhagen Coderdojo to join

Some house rules: Feel free to add anything you like - but don't pollute the top level; make a directory, and tell us what you add.

At some point we might split the repo and add an organisation, but we're keeping it light for now.
